# Video Watching Ap

The application creating by [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev)reads data from Firebase Remote Config JSON. In the application you can view and read books.

## Needed dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface or a JDK and Android Studio.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DMihail/VideoWatching.git

yarn install
```

## Step 1: Start Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
cd /ios
pod install

# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
